## 2024-05-22 - Standardized Skip Links
**Learning:** Inconsistent landmarks (e.g. `id="about"` vs missing IDs) break accessibility features like "Skip to content". Standardizing on `#main-content` across all pages ensures these links always work.
**Action:** Always verify that "Skip to content" targets exist on every page, and enforce a consistent main content ID (like `#main-content`) in the design system.
